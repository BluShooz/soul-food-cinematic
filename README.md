## 🎬 Animation Breakdown
The experience is designed to mimic a high-end food commercial (e.g. Phantom Flex4K shots):

1.  **The Reveal**: The hero dish (Fried Chicken) is visible instantly.
2.  **The Explosion**: As you scroll, fresh ingredients (greens, corn, okra, spices) explode **outwards** from the dish.
3.  **Suspension**: Ingredients drift in slow-motion ("hang time"), simulating zero-gravity.
4.  **Cinematic Blur**: Depth of field effects apply dynamically based on particle distance.
5.  **The Push-In**: The camera zooms dramatically (1.8x) onto the hero dish as ingredients fade away.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
-   **Vite**: High-performance build tooling.
-   **GSAP (GreenSock)**: Complex timeline management and ScrollTrigger.
-   **Vanilla JS/CSS**: Clean, lightweight implementation without framework overhead.
